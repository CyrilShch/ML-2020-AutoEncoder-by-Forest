# Skoltech-ML-2020-AutoEncoder-by-Forest
Typically, autoencoders (AEs) are assotiated with Neural Networks. Yet in [the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.09018.pdf) the authors propose to use Decision Tree for AE and claim that their approach has reasonable performance. Here we reproduced the paper results: implemented AE forest algorithm and compared its performance with MLP &amp; CNN  AEs on image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR).
