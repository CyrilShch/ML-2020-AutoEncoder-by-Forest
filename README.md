# Skoltech-ML-2020-AutoEncoder-by-Forest
Typically, autoencoders (AEs) are assotiated with Neural Networks. Yet in [the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.09018.pdf) the authors propose to use Decision Tree for AE and claim that their approach has reasonable performance. Here we have reproduced the paper results: we have implemented AE forest algorithm and compared its performance with MLP &amp; CNN  AEs on image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10).

The code was written by Egor Sevriugov, Kirill Scherbakov, Maria Begicheva and Olga Novitskaya.
