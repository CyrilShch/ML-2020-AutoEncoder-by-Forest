# Skoltech-ML-2020-AutoEncoder-by-Forest
Typically, autoencoders (AEs) are assotiated with Neural Networks. Yet in [the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.09018.pdf) the authors propose to use Decision Tree for AE and claim that their approach has reasonable performance. Here we have reproduced the paper results: we have implemented AE forest algorithm and compared its performance with MLP &amp; CNN  AEs on image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10).

The code was written by:

- Egor Sevriugov - Tree ensemble based AE (MNIST, CIFAR-10, Omniglot), 
- Kirill Scherbakov - CNN based AE (MNIST, CIFAR-10, Omniglot), 
- Maria Begicheva - MLP based AE (MNIST, Omniglot),
- Olga Novitskaya - MLP based AE (CIFAR-10, Omniglot)
